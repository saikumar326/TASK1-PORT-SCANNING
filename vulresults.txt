| MITRE CVE - https://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2013-3661] The EPATHOBJ::bFlatten function in win32k.sys in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and Windows RT does not check whether linked-list traversal is continually accessing the same list member, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (infinite traversal) via vectors that trigger a crafted PATHRECORD chain.
| [CVE-2013-3660] The EPATHOBJ::pprFlattenRec function in win32k.sys in the kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012 does not properly initialize a pointer for the next object in a certain list, which allows local users to obtain write access to the PATHRECORD chain, and consequently gain privileges, by triggering excessive consumption of paged memory and then making many FlattenPath function calls, aka "Win32k Read AV Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2013-3174] DirectShow in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted GIF file, aka "DirectShow Arbitrary Memory Overwrite Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2013-3173] Buffer overflow in win32k.sys in the kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and Windows RT allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted application that leverages improper handling of objects in memory, aka "Win32k Buffer Overwrite Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2013-3172] Buffer overflow in win32k.sys in the kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, and Windows 7 SP1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (system hang) via a crafted application that leverages improper handling of objects in memory, aka "Win32k Buffer Overflow Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2013-3167] win32k.sys in the kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, and Windows 7 SP1 does not properly handle objects in memory, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted application, aka "Win32k Information Disclosure Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2013-3154] The signature-update functionality in Windows Defender on Microsoft Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 relies on an incorrect pathname, which allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse application in the %SYSTEMDRIVE% top-level directory, aka "Microsoft Windows 7 Defender Improper Pathname Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2013-3138] Integer overflow in the TCP/IP kernel-mode driver in Microsoft Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and Windows RT allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system hang) via crafted TCP packets, aka "TCP/IP Integer Overflow Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2013-3136] The kernel in Microsoft Windows XP SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 on 32-bit platforms does not properly handle unspecified page-fault system calls, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted application, aka "Kernel Information Disclosure Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2013-3127] The Microsoft WMV video codec in wmv9vcm.dll, wmvdmod.dll in Windows Media Format Runtime 9 and 9.5, and wmvdecod.dll in Windows Media Format Runtime 11 and Windows Media Player 11 and 12 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted media file, aka "WMV Video Decoder Remote Code Execution Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2013-2558] Unspecified vulnerability in Microsoft Windows 8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (reboot) or possibly have unknown other impact via a crafted TrueType Font (TTF) file, as demonstrated by the 120612-69701-01.dmp error report.
| [CVE-2013-2556] Unspecified vulnerability in Microsoft Windows 7 allows attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via unknown vectors, as demonstrated against Adobe Flash Player by VUPEN during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2013.
| [CVE-2013-2554] Unspecified vulnerability in Microsoft Windows 7 allows attackers to bypass the ASLR and DEP protection mechanisms via unknown vectors, as demonstrated against Firefox by VUPEN during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2013, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-0787.

NOTE: it could be argued that if an attacker already has control over WINS/DNS, then web traffic could already be intercepted by modifying WINS or DNS records, so this would not cross privilege boundaries and would not be a vulnerability.  It has also been reported that DHCP is an alternate attack vector.
| [CVE-2007-1658] Windows Mail in Microsoft Windows Vista might allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute certain programs via a link to a (1) local file or (2) UNC share pathname in which there is a directory with the same base name as an executable program at the same level, as demonstrated using C:/windows/system32/winrm (winrm.cmd) and migwiz (migwiz.exe).

| [CVE-2007-1528] The LLTD Mapper in Microsoft Windows Vista allows remote attackers to spoof hosts, and nonexistent bridge relationships, into the network topology map by using a MAC address that differs from the MAC address provided in the Real Source field of the LLTD BASE header of a HELLO packet, aka the "Spoof on Bridge" attack.
| [CVE-2007-1527] The LLTD Mapper in Microsoft Windows Vista does not verify that an IP address in a TLV type 0x07 field in a HELLO packet corresponds to a valid IP address for the local network, which allows remote attackers to trick users into communicating with an external host by sending a HELLO packet with the MW characteristic and a spoofed TLV type 0x07 field, aka the "Spoof and Management URL IP Redirect" attack.
